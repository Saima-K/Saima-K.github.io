Branding is a new subject in my schedule! This was a very interesting assignment as I got a chance to work on a real and existing brand. I chose Amazon to rebrand and to give it a new look. Amazon is a very interesting brand to work on. The logo mark that I made for Amazon has a meaning similar to what it has in present. The infinity shows the wide range and never ending offers that Amazon gives to it's customers. While the tick mark stands for the home delivery that it provides us with and it supports it's tag line "and you are done."
The logo type is completely hand crafted and gives a friendly and an approachable look. This look suits the reputation and image that the brand Amazon has in the market.
