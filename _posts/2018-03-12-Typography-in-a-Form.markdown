NMIMS school of design is the new trend in my life. School of Design (SOD), for me, stands for it's integrated system where all work together and stand strong. It is about a creative mind and it's impact in the society. To bring my thoughts to life I made a display piece with typography and gave it a form. This installation shows SOD as a body of creativity and interdependence. It holds our final product with all it's prototypes.
